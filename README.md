## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Key learnings:
- how to apply background image using background: url('link') 
- the plan anchor element was placed using margin-left:auto which means that it will take all the available space on left for the margin

```css
.plan-anchor{
    margin-left: auto;
    font-size: 15px;
}
```
